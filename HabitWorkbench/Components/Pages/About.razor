<h1>About HabitWorkbench</h1>

<div style="max-width:900px;">

    <p>
        HabitWorkbench is a private, local-first desktop tool for designing, testing,
        and improving routines and habits.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is intentionally designed to work offline, store data locally,
        and stay out of your way while you think and iterate.
    </p>
